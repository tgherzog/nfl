nfl('MIN').schedule              # full schedule
nfl.NFC                          # NFC and AFC are available as properties
nfl.wlt(['MIN', 'GB'])           # win/loss/tie info
nfl.tiebreakers(['DAL', 'PHI'])  # tiebreaker calculations
nfl.NFC.playoffs()               # playoff picture, if season ended today
